# Message Generator

### Codecademy Portfolio Project Message Generator


Project Objectives:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer


### Planning and Topic:
Visualize the result. What is it built with? What can it do?

#### Game Idea Generator
Needs 3 parts of random generation.  

#### Original Idea:
Use a random template, then generate topics within that template. 
IE: â€œA ___ goes on an adventure to ___ a ___ from ____ the world. 
Similar to mad libs. 

#### After some consideration, changed plan of implementation.
Instead of using templates,maybe break the template down into parts.

- Subject
- Action
- Reason

#### Store message components:
Use an array for each component

### Functionality:
Generate a random number between 0 and the  length of each component array

Concat the components together in a result string
